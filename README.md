Abstract Syntax Tree (Project 4 of 6 from a Compilers/Interpreters course)
-------------------

This program includes a Parser that builds an AST to model programs written in a dummy programming language called Crux. The Parser recognizes syntax errors, symbol definitions, usage errors, as well as some type errors.

All the work under src/crux/ is by me (kevdez), except AutoTesterProject4.java.
